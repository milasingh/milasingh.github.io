<div class ="adventure_list">
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong></li>
        <p>Thailand is an amazing country. Although it is a long flight from the east coast of the U.S. (about 20 hr), it is worth the long haul. Bangkok is a city that will entice your senses with its amazing night markets. Then on the contrary, it will reveal a peaceful and spiritual side through its many beautiful Buddhist temples, called Wats. Take some time to explore both sides of the city - the craziness of the markets and the peacefulness of the temples. </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Santiago, Chile</strong></li>
        <p>Santiago is definitely an underrated South American city. It has beautiful wine country and rich history. Explore museums and historical sites or escape on a road trip into the Andes Mountains. If you are a skier, you'll also feel right at home. For the non-skiers out there (like me) there is delicious food (especially seafood and avocado), wine, and plenty to explore in this walkable city.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Playa del Carmen, Mexico</strong></li>
        <p>Playa del Carmen is just outside of Cancun, and it is a much better vacation option than Cancun for those of you who are over the college spring break crowd. Don't get me wrong, you are still close to lots of restaurants, bars, and dancehalls, but the beaches are quieter and more beautiful. If you aren't a beach person, you can go swimming in the underwater caves (Cenotes). Also, Mexican food is the BEST in Mexico! Get yourself some tacos or Ceviche and have a feast. </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong></li>
        <p>Dublin is a premier destination for Guiness fans, as it is the home of the Guiness Brewery, where you can go on a tour to learn the history and production process of this famous dark beer. There are lots of great museums, bars, and historical sites to check out in this walkable city. If you have the time, rent a car and check out the beautiful surrounding country side. Make sure you bring an umbrella with you, depending on the time of year it can get rainy and cold. Irish food is delicous and comforting as well, but I wouldn't call Dublin a foodie's paradise. It is definitely more of a city to enjoy and explore and drink in, literally and figuratively!</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong></li>
        <p>By far, this has been my favorite city to visit in the past year. Being from NYC, I'm often underwhelmed when I visit other supposedly big cities, but Tokyo blew me away. The infrastructure is super modern - amazing bullet trains that travel so fast between cities, I couldn't fathom it until I experienced it. So many people and stores everywhere. Shoppers can rejoice, exploring endless retail outlets. My absolute #1 reason, though, for visiting Japan was the food. It is a country with the most Michelin star restaurants, and Tokyo has so many food options it would take years to explore everything. I tried fancy resaurants all the way down to corner shops, and I was never disappointed. Lastly, Tokyo (and the rest of the country) has such a rich history and lots of beautiful sites to explore including temples, castles, markets and more. You will fall in love with this city.</p>
