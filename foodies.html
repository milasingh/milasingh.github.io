    <p>If you can't already tell, I'm obsessed with delicious food. I travel to experience other cultures, and much of that is experiencing the food and meal times with locals. Here are my top 3 favorite dishes ever. Make sure you order these when visiting the following countries.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dosa - India</strong></li>
        <p>This crepe-like, crispy dish can be eaten plain or filled with potatoes, dubbed masala dosa. It is served fresh on the street or in restaurants. You must eat it made to order because it is best when hot and crispy.</p>
        <li><strong>Pastel de Chocolo - Chile</strong></li>
        <p>This is a corn pie filled with meat (usually beef), onions, and corn. There may also be eggs, raisins, and olives in or on top of the pie. The dish is baked in a large skillet and served piping hot. It is slightly sweet and savory at the same time and is the ultimate Chilean comfort food.</p>
        <li><strong>Ramen - Japan</strong></li>
        <p>I know. You are probably thinking, I can make ramen at home for 99 cents out of a plastic packet. Although sometimes we all need that quick fix meal, real ramen is ridiculously different than the packet ramen. When made fresh to order, it is incredibly delicous. You can select different types with various broths. My favorite types are the creamy broths full of mushrooms and other veggies. In Japan they also have a bunch of different spices you can use to season your ramen. You can get it in fancy restaurants or in corner shops for cheap. Try both and see which you love best. If I lived in Japan, I'd eat ramen at least three times a week.</p>
    </ul>
