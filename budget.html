<h1 style="text-align:center;">But I have no $$$! How can I travel more, for less?</h1>
<div class="budget_advice">
    <p>I totally get it. Travel is expensive, especially overseas travel. People forget that airline tickets and hotel are only a portion of the total costs of a trip. After those basics, you then have to have money for food, tours, shows, museum fees, and other local experiences that will enrich your time in a country.</p>
    <p>So what's a travel hungry, wanderluster to do? Well, don't fret. There are lots of ways to travel on a dime. You can get your travel high while making sure you don't break the bank by following these five tips.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Plan ahead.</strong></li>
        <p>Don't plan too far in advance, unless it is a complicated trip with lots of moving pieces - such as hiking Mt. Kilimanjaro. But give yourself a few months to plan your trip. Write our your budget and select desinations based on your budget. Generally, overseas trips are going to be more expensive, but if you do some research, you may be able to snag decent airfair. For example, I've gotten tickets to Europe for less than $500 and tickets to Asia for less than $900. However, it depends on timing and a little bit of luck. So do some googling to see what typical costs of airfare and hotel are for your goal destiantion, and then track prices using a tool like Kayak or Expedia.</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Use Google flights</strong></li>
        <p>This is one of my favorite tools right now. On Google flights, you can pick departure and return dates and it will tell you all the different prices corresponding with different dates. If you are flexible on travel dates, this is a great way to price compare traveling at different times. If you are like me and constantly looking for a new place to visit, you can also use this tool to see what different destiantions could cost you flying out of your home airport. Try it out! You may end up booking a flight to some place new.</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Try Airbnb instead of a traditional hotel.</strong></li>
        <p>If you haven't given Airbnb a shot yet, try it out. In some countries, it can save you big bucks, and you may end up in a much more comfortable abode than you expected. When my friends and I visited Austin we got a great deal on an Airbnb, and we were all able to stay in a fantastic house. For group travel or for families this is a great way to experience a city while staying in a place that feels like home.</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Get a travel book.</strong></li>
        <p>Tours of cities can be expensive and not always worth the money. Especially for well-traveled cities, there are a ton of free online resources and blogs that you can read to understand the best things to do. Also, there are some great travel books out there that will give you instructions on walking tours along with detailed explanations of sites. When I traveled to Barcelona, Spain, Rick Steves' Barcelona Pocket Guide was an amazing resource that saved us a lot of money. We were easily able to navigate sites and museums. We did the walking tours outlined in the book and had a great time.</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Couch surf</strong></li>
        <p>I'll admit, I haven't couch surfed on random people's couches. I'm not sure I ever will. But if you are brave, go for it. If you are more like me, try checking to see where your friends are living and see if you can crash at their places for awhile. This is a great way to catch up with friends while also getting to experience different places. Plus your friends will know all the awesome places to check out. Make sure to return the favor though, and welcome friends to your home as well.</p>
